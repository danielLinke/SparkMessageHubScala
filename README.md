### Overview

This project provides a hello world style example that connects to messagehub from spark as a service on bluemix.

### Instructions

Import the [notebooks](./notebooks) into DSX and follow the instructions.  After you get the example working, it is recommended that you should inspect the code in the folder [/src/main/scala/net/christophersnow](./src/main/scala/net/christophersnow) to familiarise yourself with what it is doing. 

### Environment

The notebooks have been tested against Spark 1.6 and may not work against Spark 2.0.
